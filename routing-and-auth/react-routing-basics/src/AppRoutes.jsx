/**
 * AppRoutes component defines the routing structure for the application.
 * It uses react-router-dom for routing and react-redux for state management. You need to create the import for the React Router components you need.
 * 
 * Routes:
 * - "/" renders the Home component.
 * - "/about" renders the About component.
 * - "/posts" renders the Posts component.
 * - "*" renders the NotFound component for any undefined routes.
 * 
 * See: https://reactrouter.com/start/library/routing.
